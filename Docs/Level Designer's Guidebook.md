This workflow guide to allow us to produces better looking levels which are both richly engaging for the player in the game, while still being intuitive for the designers to understand and navigate.  

I recently added a number of tilesets with more sophisticated patterns, so to get the most out of these new art assets I decided to write a guide for how to combine all these various pieces of art to create beautiful levels that are still functional and modular.  As more art is added to a level it can become increasingly difficult to manage all the objects in the scene. At this point we have some gameobjects in the scene which are visual only (decorative props, trees, backgrounds) and some that are functional (like the camera, the pathfinding system, and the game manager) and some that are both (like the player, enemies, and tilemaps).   For this reason it's important to use
